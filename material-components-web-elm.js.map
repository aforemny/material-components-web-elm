On the other hand, Elm does controls some class names (ie.\n * mdc-text-field).\n *\n * This means that currently, Elm's virtual dom library assumes sole control\n * over class names, since it sets a DOM node's `className` property. Thus, if\n * a Elm-controlled class name changes, it might delete additional uncontrolled\n * class names.\n *\n * We work around this issue by patching a DOM node's `className` property in\n * the following way:\n * (1) We may assume that Elm only ever touches `className`\n * (2) We may assume that Material Components only ever touch `classList`\n *\n * Thus, whenever a write to `className` happens, we record the list of classes\n * that Elm has control over (classes that have been added via `className`).\n * Then we identify classes removed via `className`, and we only allow removal\n * of classes that Elm has control over. Classes added via the `classList`\n * property cannot be removed via the `className` property.\n *\n * We will not require this fix anymore once Elm's virtual dom implementation\n * uses `classList.add`, `classList.remove` to manage class names.\n *\n * In addition to this, there are some class names that Elm should assume\n * control over for the first frame, but may not remove them in subsequent\n * frames. Those class names are class names that fall into the component\n * state, but may have to be set by Elm in the first frame to prevent a flash\n * of unstyled content (FOUC).\n *\n * The logic for those is implemented similarly, with the exception that the\n * classNames have to be listed in the node's property `foucClassNames`.\n */\n\nfunction setClassName(className) {\n  const css = className.split(\" \").filter(cs => cs !== \"\");\n  for (let cs of css) {\n    this.classList.add(cs)\n  };\n  for (let cs of this.className_) {\n    if ((!!this.foucClassNames) && (this.foucClassNames.includes(cs))) return;\n    if (!css.includes(cs)) this.classList.remove(cs);\n  }\n  this.className_ = css;\n}\n\nfunction getClassName() {\n  return `${this.classList}`;\n}\n\nexport function installClassNameChangeHook() {\n  Object.defineProperty(this, \"className\", {\n    get: getClassName.bind(this),\n    set: setClassName.bind(this),\n    configurable: true,\n  });\n  this.className_ = [...this.classList];\n};\n\nexport function uninstallClassNameChangeHook() {\n  let object = Object.getPrototypeOf(this);\n  let descriptor;\n  while (!(descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(object, \"className\"))) {\n    object = Object.getPrototypeOf(object);\n  }\n  Object.defineProperty(this, \"className\", descriptor);\n  delete this.className_;\n  this.className = getClassName.call(this);\n};\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
